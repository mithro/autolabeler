# Probot Auto Labeler

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/probot/autolabeler.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

> A GitHub App built with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that adds labels to Pull Requests based on matched file patterns.

## Using

Configure by creating a `.github/autolabeler.yml` file with a [YAML file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) in the format of `label: file/path`. Then add the [Probot Auto Labeler Bot](https://github.com/apps/probot-autolabeler) to your repository.

For example,

```yaml
frontend: ["*.js", "*.css", "*.html"]
backend: ["/app", "*.rb"]
legal: ["LICENSE*", "NOTICES*"]
config: .github
```

Then if a pull request is opened that has `scripts/widget.js` modified, then the frontend label will be added.

##### Issues with Bot

If you are having issues with [the GitHub app not working](https://github.com/apps/probot-autolabeler), please [open an issue](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler/issues).


## Setup

```
# Install dependencies
